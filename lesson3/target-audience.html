      <h2>Taget Audience</h2>
      <p>The main target audience of this page is the residents of Idaho. The weather page will also target secondarily any visitors to Idaho. This Site will prepare the users of this site for whatever the weather will be and will be able to be used by any that have knowledge of basic internet skills.</p>
      <h2>Persona 1</h2>
      <p>Person 1 is an elderly man Idaho who is trying to plan a weekend trip. He needs to know the temprature, rain status, and wether or not there will be clouds. He needs a site that can present all this data to him in a clear, easily accessible form so that he can get his information without diving too deep into the website with his limited skills.</p>
      <h2> Persona 2</h2>
      <p>Person 2 is a middle aged woman who works at the university in the physics department. She is planning science experiments and needs in depth data of the days past as well as the best future weather predictions so that she can plan her experiments and document them. The data doesn't need to be quite as accessible to her as she will be able to find the information she needs, but she does need the data to presented somewhere in a usable form.</p>
      <h2>Scenarios</h2>
      <p>I need to decide what to wear today to school, what will the temprature be like?</p>
      <p>I live in Montana and will be visiting Idaho to go boating. Will it be raining any of the days I am there?</p>
      <p>I'd like to fly a kite sometime soon, are we supposed to have any wind this week?</p>
      <p>Yesterday was particularly cold, I'd like to know just how cold it was.</p>
      <p>The air quality today seems pretty bad because of all the fires, I wonder if it will be healthy for me to go outside.</p>
